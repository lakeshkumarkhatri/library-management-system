# Library Management System

This repository contains the **progressive development** of a Library Management System
implemented across multiple academic semesters as part of my **BS Software Engineering** degree.

Each version represents the concepts, tools, and programming practices learned during that semester,
showing a clear evolution from basic console programming to GUI, database integration,
and data-structure–driven design.

## 📌 Project Versions

### 🔹 Semester 1 — C++ (Console-Based)
- Implemented using C++
- Menu-driven console application
- File handling for data persistence
- Focus on programming fundamentals and logic building

📁 Folder: `cpp-version/`

---

### 🔹 Semester 2 — Java Swing + DBMS
- GUI-based application using Java Swing
- MySQL database integration
- JDBC for database connectivity
- Structured separation between UI and database logic

📁 Folder: `java-swing-dbms-version/`

---

### 🔹 Semester 3 — Java + Data Structures (Current)
- Enhancement of Semester 2 project
- Application of Data Structures (Lists, Maps, undo operations)
- Improved logic, performance, and code organization
- Multiple Java classes with clearer responsibility separation
- Database retained for realism and continuity

📁 Folder: `java-dsa-version/`

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This project demonstrates my **learning progression** as a Software Engineering student,
moving from basic console applications to GUI-based and data-structure–driven systems.

Future semesters will introduce:
- Layered architecture (UI / Service / Data)
- Better scalability and modularity
- Advanced software design principles
